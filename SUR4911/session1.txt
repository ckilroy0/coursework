okay so today i want to get some imagery
so i think i have to do is go to the arctic dem website
and then on the web page there's a section called arctic dem strips
are there a downloads for arctic dem strip d e m extent index cheap file
and there's also a browser for arctic dm strip dms
it's taking a while to load
could also download geo databases or geo packages
tulsa download from amazon web services
why is he so big music and 17 kilometers
elevation is in meters and they are reference to the wgs84 ellipsoid the website says that no ground control or altimetry registration has been applied to the strips
strip dm dimensions vary but most strips are between 13 km and 17 km in width and 110 km and 120 km in length
i'll be right back there are also arctic dem mosaics
mosaic dem bowser compelled from the entire stack of strip dems the height value for each pixel is derived from the median value of all contributing strip dems
mosaic dm files are distributed at 2 m spatial resolution as 50/50 km tiles in 32-bit geo tip formats
kilometer tiles then there are 100 m 500 m and 1 km mosaics elevation units are meters and relative to wgs84 ellipsoid
it looks like we're going to be using the mosaic so it looks like i've actually been provided with the mosaic index
and then i've been given a filtered landslide shapefile data set so instead of these two that we were working with before we might be using a new one so let's go ahead and check that out too
okay so now i have two sets of shape files for change to poly g i have greenland folder and 033 noise water
which was using the define projection data management tool
significantly reduced change to pauly 03 vl now has 1721 areas
phone number radio south carolina lottery results period
yeah 3306
change to paulie g 0.3 landslide now has 306 areas
i'm going to run an intersection to count the number of intersections i'm running the intersect analysis tool
files output feature class is the intersection
the input features are the two polygons feature classes the output feature classes the intersection i'm joining all attributes the appetite is the same as the input control phone number radio south carolina lottery results period i don't know where it got that
there are 13 intersections
shape lengths is 0.06 or lower
shape area is 5006 or lower
4 intersections have vl field id 168
the intersection of ids
13 intersections the resulting features do not appear to actually be intersections
distance between the polygons to be close to 300 kilometers
i identified two polygons that returned an intersection
and then measure the distance between the polygons and then measure the distance between the polygons
hello computer are you hearing me
i identified two polygons that returned and intersection and measured the distance between the two polygons the distance was close to 300 km
there appears to be a geometry error in landslide polygon 1068
168 168
correction vl polygon 168
