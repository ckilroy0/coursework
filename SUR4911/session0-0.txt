check
i am working with the polygons in a region in greenland as well as the 2017 carat fjord greenland landslide included in greenland zip
projection epsg colon 4326
i've loaded the shape files into arcgis pro
there are three shape files
the shape files are 2017 green landslide change to holly g03 vl and change to polly g 03 landslide
2017 greenland slide contains a single point
change to poly g shape files contain polygons
change to pauly g03 vls for fid shape feature type shape area and zone
i'm generating summary statistics for change to poly g03 vl to determine unique statistics for the zone field
there is one unique zone called scar s c a r
the frequency for scar s c a r is 14991
the total number of entries in change to poly g03 vl is 14991
show all fields share the same zone
i'm now inspecting change to poly g03 landslide
there are 6840 entries
i'm performing the same operation to determine unique zones
all entries have the same zone scar s c a r entries have the same zone star sc a r
the 2017 greenland slide point is projected onto greenland 52.33 degrees west 71.64 degrees north
the two polygons shapes files are projected near null island will need to be rejected
i am duplicating one of the polygon shape files
i'm using the project data management tool
the project data management tool projects spatial data from one coordinate system to another
as the input data set
7 the coordinate system is not defined for the input data set the feature class feature layer feature data set scene layer or scene layer package to be projected
i'm selecting the copied change to paulie gee 03 vl data set as the input data set
the tool has returned error 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 7
well instead of project i am using define projection data management tool
define projection overrides the coordinate system information stored with the data set the tool is intended for data sets that have an unknown or incorrect coordinate system defined
i'm setting the coordinate system as epsg colon 4326
84 world geodetic system 1984
the shape file has been correctly projected
i'm repeating the projection for the other shape file
i am removing the copied shape file
