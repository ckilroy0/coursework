using DEM time series to map landslides in the Arctic. I have compiled some polygons of potential landslides. However, I need help to identify if the polygon is real or not based on local topography and slope information.
thresholding
elevation
hillshade
visual identification difficult because of large study area: whole arctic
percent reduction in area
classification, optimization
input data: ArcticDEM elevation maps, polygons of potential landslides
start with small area to figure out process then expand to larger area
visual bands to differentiate from vegetation (maybe later)
ArcticDEM mosaic
Derive from elevations: slope, terrain, aspect, etc
start with 32 meter to figure out process then increase resolution to 2 meter
least squares
temporal change in distributions to classify
monte carlo experiments on parameters
analyzing surface patches, reduce computation time and extraneous data processing
