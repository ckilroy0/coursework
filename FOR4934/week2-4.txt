Write a scientific essay on this "forest structure and functions (ecosystem services)
stands are contiguous groups of trees, distinguishable unit
savannas hve scattered overstory, low woody or herbaceous understory
open structures are missing trees and have only understory vegetation
measure: number of trees, height of trees, size (diameter) of trees, species, height to living crown
structure is dynamic
temporal element development stages: open ground, stand initiation (constant introduction of new species), stem exclusion (competitive stage, decades to hundreds of years), under story reinitiation (thinning of trees, understory grows), old growth (all original trees have been replaced).
disturbances set back development, prevent old growth from occurring
stands can be in different stage of development, but it is the same community
functionality of forest community: evapotranspiration rates, other measures as function of plant density structure"
Contain as much information as possible with as little text as possible. Use clear wording.
