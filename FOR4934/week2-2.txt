hard freezes, pre and post freeze stand observations
hardiness zones, tropical vs temperate species distributions
climate change shifting zones
flooding: timing, seasonality, length of flood, inundation, depth
broad leafs tolerate floods better than pines (cypress exception, adventitious roots)
flooding and growing season is more detrimental than in dormant season: more active so higher need for oxygen and carbon dioxide to sustain photosynthesis; more susceptible during spring after first budding because starved for resources.
first budding occurs at different times throughout the world; warm and cold seasons, rainy seasons; compare whittaker biomes.
cold water less injurious than warmer water because holds more dissolved oxygen
recent flooding many plants can endure short flooding but not long
reoccurring short floods can have same effects as long-term flooding
depth of water has little influence after soil is saturated and covered however it matters when it covers foliage; submergence is less tolerated in young plants seedlings or saplings.
soil deposition inches to feet
saltwater storm surges most trees not adapted to salt (salt tolerance)
