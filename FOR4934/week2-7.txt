autotrophs: photoautotrophs, chemoautotrophs
trophic structure: primary energy source is taken up by primary producers which are consumed by primary consumers who in turn are consumed by secondary consumers and so on up to the apex predator; along this chain, waste is produced which is fed on by detritivores
trophic structure depicts how energy flows within an ecosystem
trophic structure can be depicted as a food chain or a food web
efficiency and energy transfer only 10% of consumed energy is used by an organism, so 10 times as much food is needed to be eaten by consumers. this leads to 10 times as much bioaccumulation (toxin accumulation). example, mercury in fish"
