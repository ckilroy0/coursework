the current process consists of three inputs and two outputs
inputs: liquid egg, oil (typically soybean), and powdered spices
the egg and oil is received as liquid in a tank
the liquid egg is taken out of the tank by attaching a hose opening a valve and pumping it into a receiving tank
similarly, the oil is pumped to a holding tank
the spices are received as a powder
along with vinegar, salt, liquid natural flavors, and water, the powdered spices are added to a slurry tank
the eggs, oil, and spice slurry are pumped to a mixing vessel in a computerized process
the mixing vessel is agitated to mix
periodic quality and consistency tests are taken from the mixing vessel
the product is filled into a jar and a cap with a seal is placed on top
heat is applied to the cap with seal to seal the jar
the label is then glued to the jar
some jars are randomly sampled for a final inspection and consistency test
alternatively some of the product is added to a plastic pouch the pouches then sealed which is ready for packaging and shipping
